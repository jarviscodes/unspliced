# Unspliced

Sick and tired of having 5000 unsorted samples in your sound library?

This tool will attempt to sort them properly according to file name, which should do the trick for MOST samples coming from Splice.

# Disclaimer
Very much WIP, don't break your projects with this :-) Contributions, PR's, Issues are welcome.

Please don't use this tool if you do not  more or less understand what the code is doing.

Developed and tested on Windows. Hide yo Macs (or create Issues / PR's)

Currently only copies files non-destructively rather than removing them.
